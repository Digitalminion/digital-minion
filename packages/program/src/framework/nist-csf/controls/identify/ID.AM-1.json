  "guidance": "Organizations should establish and maintain a comprehensive inventory of all physical devices that connect to the organization's network or process, store, or transmit organizational data. This includes but is not limited to: servers, workstations, laptops, mobile devices, network equipment, IoT devices, and operational technology. The inventory should be regularly updated to reflect additions, changes, and removals. Automated discovery tools can help maintain accuracy.",
